# Basic chat bot (Version 1.2)

## How to install
```commandline
mkvirtualenv chatbot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## About the bot
This bot will not win any awards but rather is a proof of concept for handling persisting data about the user. The bot can handle a series of tasks and events where, once prompted they will insist that the user answers them and then save the answer into memory.
